Each node represents a\nspecific task or action, such as retrieving data from an API, processing information, or sending\nan email. By connecting nodes, you define the sequence and logic of your automated\nprocesses.\nTypes of Nodes:\n1. Trigger Nodes:\n○ Initiate workflows based on specific events or schedules. A trigger node is\nidentified by an orange lightning bolt.\n○ Examples:\n■ Webhook Trigger: Starts a workflow when a specific URL is called.\n■ Execute Workflow Trigger: Starts a workflow when another workflow\ncalls it.\n■ Gmail Trigger: Starts a workflow when an email is received.","\n2. Regular Nodes:\n○ Perform actions like data retrieval, transformation, and delivery.\n○ Examples:\n■ HTTP Request Node: Makes HTTP requests to external APIs.\n■ Filter Node: Filters data on a defined condition.\n■ Merge Node: Appends or combines two datasets\n\nNode Structure\nEach node comprises:\n● Parameters: Settings that define the node's behavior (e.g., API endpoints,\nauthentication details).\n● Input/Output Data: Data received from preceding nodes and passed to subsequent\nnodes.\n● Credentials (Not Always): Authentication information for accessing external services\nsecurely.\nConnecting Nodes:\nNodes are linked to establish the flow of data and the sequence of operations. The output of\none node becomes the input for the next, creating a cohesive workflow.\nResources:\n● Connecting Google Credentials in 5 Minutes: Watch the Video on YouTube\n● Lead Nurturing Automated Workflow: Watch the Video on YouTube\n● AI Inbox Manager: Watch the Video on YouTube\n● n8n Documentation: Nodes\nProvides detai","led information on the various nodes available in n8n and their\nfunctionalities.\n● n8n Community Forum: Code Node for Beginners\nOffers insights and examples on using the Code node effectively. (I always use ChatGPT\nor Claude to do my coding in n8n for me)\nLesson 2.2: Exploring Core Nodes\nOverview of Core Nodes:\n\nn8n offers a set of built-in core nodes essential for various operations:\n1. Edit Fields (Set) Node:\n○ Defines and manipulates data within the workflow.\n○ Allows setting static or dynamic values for use in subsequent nodes.\n2. Code Node:\n○ Executes custom JavaScript code.\n○ Enables complex data transformations and logic implementation.\n3. HTTP Request Node:\n○ Performs HTTP requests to interact with external APIs.\n○ Supports various methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.\n\n4. Merge Node:\n○ Combines data from multiple nodes.\n○ Supports operations like merging by index or key.\n5. Other useful “no-code” nodes:\n○ Split Out:\ni. Breaks a single input into multiple items, allowing you"," to process each\nitem individually.\n○ Aggregate:\ni. Combines multiple items into a single output by grouping or summarizing\ndata.\n○ Limit:\ni. Restricts the number of items processed or passed through to\nsubsequent nodes.\nPractical Applications:\n● Edit Fields Node: Define default values or transform incoming data for consistency.\n● Code Node: Apply custom calculations or data formatting not covered by standard\nnodes.\n● HTTP Request Node: Fetch data from a REST API to enrich workflow information.\n● Merge Node: Combine data from two different sources for consolidated processing.\nResources:\n● Scrape Unlimited Emails for Free: Watch the Video on YouTube\n● Multi AI Agent System: Watch the Video Here\n● n8n Documentation: Core Nodes Library\nProvides detailed information on each core node, including usage examples and\nconfigurations.\n\n● n8n Documentation: HTTP Request Node\nOffers guidance on configuring the HTTP Request node for interacting with external\nAPIs.\nLesson 2.3: Using Data Transformat","ions Effectively\nOverview\nData transformation is essential when integrating various APIs, services, and data formats in\nn8n. This lesson focuses on manipulating data to ensure compatibility and streamline\nautomation workflows. You'll explore tools like the Set Node, expressions, and the Function\nNode for handling both simple and complex data transformations. Additionally, you'll learn about\nvariables and the notation used in n8n for accessing and manipulating data.\n1. Understanding Data Structures in n8n\nJSON Format in n8n\nIn n8n, nodes output a payload of data represented as a JSON array of objects. Each top-level\nobject in the payload is considered an Item of data in n8n. By default, every node in n8n\nperforms its configured action on each incoming item routed into its input.\nUnderstanding the structure of JSON is crucial for efficiently manipulating and extracting data in\nworkflows. Here are the key JSON components:\n● Key-Value Pairs: \n{ \"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30 }\n● Arrays: \n[ \"ite","m1\", \"item2\", \"item3\" ]\n● Nested Objects: \n{ \"customer\": { \"name\": \"John\", \"email\":\n\"john@example.com\" } }\nNavigating Nested Data\nTo work with nested data, you can access fields using dot notation or square bracket\nnotation, and you can reference previous node data in two ways:\n● Relative Referencing: Use \n$json \nto access the immediately previous node’s data.\n○ Example: \n{{$json[\"customer\"][\"name\"]}} \naccesses the \n\"name\" \nfield\ninside \n\"customer\" \nfrom the current node's data.\n● Absolute Referencing: Use \n$node[\"NodeName\"].json \nto access data from a\nspecific previous node.\n\n○ Example: \n{{$node[\"Webhook\"].json[\"data\"][\"order\"][\"id\"]}}\nretrieves the \n\"id\" \nfield from the \n\"order\" \nobject output by the Webhook node.\nThis distinction between relative and absolute referencing ensures flexibility when working with\ndata from multiple nodes, enabling efficient data manipulation and workflow construction.\nResources:\n● Understanding the data structure | n8n Docs\n● Quick Primer on data structu","res in n8n\n2. Using the Set Node\nThe Edit Fields (Set) Node allows you to define and modify data fields within a workflow.\n● Static Data:\nAdd predefined static values to a workflow. Example:\n○ Adding a constant like \n\"company\": \"N8N Inc.\" \nfor use in later nodes.\n● Dynamic Data:\nMap and transform incoming data to new fields. Example:\n○ Input: \n{\"orderId\": \"12345\"}\n○ Output with Set Node: \n{\"Order_ID\": \"12345\"}\nSteps to Use the Edit Fields (Set) Node:\n1. Add the Edit Fields (Set) Node to your workflow.\n2. Define fields under \"Values\" → \"Add Field.\"\n3. Use expressions like \n{{$json[\"fieldName\"]}} \nto map dynamic data.\nResources:\n● Transform data in Google Sheets | n8n workflow template\n● n8n Nodemation basic - transforming json (3/3) (Tutorial)\n3. Expressions in n8n\nUsing Expressions in n8n\n\nExpressions in n8n allow you to dynamically access, transform, and use data from nodes. They\nfunction much like a mail merge, where placeholders are replaced with actual values from your\nworkflow.\nKe","y Expressions\n1. Accessing Data\n● Current Node Data: Use {{$json[\"field\"]}} to access data from the current node.\nExample: \n{{$json[\"firstName\"]}} \nretrieves the value of the \n\"firstName\" \nfield\nfrom the current node's data.\n● Previous Node Data: Use {{$node[\"NodeName\"].json[\"field\"]}} to retrieve data from a\nspecific previous node.\nExample: {{$node[\"Webhook\"].json[\"order\"][\"id\"]}} retrieves the \"id\" field from the \"order\"\nobject output by the Webhook node.\n2. Combining Fields\n● You can combine fields and text to create dynamic outputs:\n○ Example: \nHello {{ $json[\"firstName\"] }}\n○ Output: \nHello John.\n3. Alternative Syntax\nWhile {{\"Hello \" + $json[\"firstName\"]}} is also valid, the simpler syntax {{\n$json[\"firstName\"] }} \nis often preferred in low-code environments for readability and\nease of use.\nWhy This Matters\nThinking of expressions as a \"mail merge\" can help you grasp their flexibility in customizing\noutputs, making them intuitive for both technical and non-technical users.\nPracti","cal Use:\n● Combine dynamic text fields for an email subject line:\n○ \n{{$json[\"firstName\"] + \" placed order #\" +\n$json[\"orderId\"]}}\nResources:\n● n8n Tutorials - YouTube\n\n4. Advanced Data Manipulations with the Function Node\nThe Code Node in n8n lets you use custom JavaScript for complex data transformations. It\nprovides flexibility for advanced use cases, as long as the output is a valid n8n item format: an\narray of objects (or an empty array).\nExamples\nDate Conversion\nConvert a timestamp into a readable format:\nreturn [{ date: new Date($json[\"timestamp\"]).toLocaleString() }];\nArray Filtering\nExtract specific items from an array:\nreturn $json[\"items\"].filter(item => item.price > 50);\nPerform Calculations\nCalculate a total amount:\nreturn [{ totalPrice: $json[\"quantity\"] * $json[\"unitPrice\"] }];\nSteps to Use the Code Node\n1. Add the Code Node to your workflow.\n2. Write your JavaScript code in the \"Code\" section.\n3. Use \nreturn \nto output transformed data in the required format: an array o","f objects or an\nempty array.\nKey Note\nAlways ensure the output adheres to n8n’s expected format. For example:\nValid Output:\nreturn [{ key1: \"value1\", key2: \"value2\" }];\nEmpty Output:\nreturn [];\nBy adhering to this format, your workflows will run smoothly and handle data correctly.\nResources:\n● Process data using code | n8n Docs\n\n● Code Node for Beginners - Tips & Tricks\n5. Variables in n8n and Understanding the Notation\nIn n8n, variables are essential for accessing and manipulating data within workflows.\nUnderstanding how to utilize these variables and the appropriate notation is crucial for effective\nworkflow development.\nTypes of Variables:\n1. Helper Variables:\n○ \n$json\n: Represents the data of the current node. It's commonly used to access\nthe input data within the node where the expression is written.\ni. Resource: n8n Documentation\n○ \n$node\n: Allows access to the output data of other nodes in the workflow. This is\nparticularly useful when you need to reference data from previous no","des.\n○ \n$workflow\n: Provides information about the current workflow, such as its name\nand ID. This can be helpful for logging or conditional operations based on\nworkflow metadata.\ni. Resource: n8n Documentation\n○ \n$env\n: Enables access to environment variables set in your n8n instance. This is\nuseful for managing configuration values that may vary between different\nenvironments (e.g., development, staging, production).\ni. Resource: n8n Community\nNotation for Accessing Data:\nDot Notation:\nUsed to access object properties directly when the property names are simple (i.e., they don't\ncontain spaces, special characters, or start with a number).\n{{$json.customer.name}}\n● In this example, \ncustomer \nis an object within the current node's JSON data, and \nname\nis a property of that object.\nSquare Bracket Notation:\nNecessary when property names include spaces, special characters, or are dynamic (e.g.,\nstored in another variable).\n{{$json[\"customer name\"]}}\n\n● This approach ensures that property"," names with spaces or special characters are\ncorrectly interpreted.\nAccessing Data from Other Nodes:\nTo reference data from a different node within your workflow, use the \n$node \nvariable combined\nwith the appropriate notation:\n{{$node[\"PreviousNodeName\"].json[\"fieldName\"]}}\nReplace \n\"PreviousNodeName\" \nwith the exact name of the node you're referencing and\n\"fieldName\" \nwith the specific field you wish to access.\nPractical Example:\nSuppose you have a node named \"Webhook\" that receives the following JSON payload:\n{\n\"order\": {\n\"id\": \"12345\",\n\"customer\": {\n\"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n\"email\": \"jane.doe@example.com\"\n},\n\"items\": [\n{\n\"product\": \"Laptop\",\n\"quantity\": 1,\n\"price\": 1200\n}\n]\n}\n}\nTo extract the customer's email from this payload in a subsequent node, you would use:\n{{$node[\"Webhook\"].json[\"order\"][\"customer\"][\"email\"]}}\n\nThis expression drills down through the nested JSON structure to retrieve the desired value.\nBest Practices:\n● Consistent Naming: Use consistent and descriptive names for"," your nodes and data\nfields to make expressions more readable and maintainable.\n● Error Handling: Be cautious of null or undefined values when accessing nested\nproperties. Consider using optional chaining (e.g., \n{{$json?.customer?.name}}\n) to\nprevent errors if a property doesn't exist.\n● Testing Expressions: Utilize n8n's expression editor to test and validate your\nexpressions, ensuring they return the expected results before implementing them in your\nworkflow.\nLesson 2.4: Integrating Third-Party Services\nConnecting to External Applications:\nn8n enables seamless integration with various third-party services, allowing for automated data\nexchange and process management across platforms.\nMethods of Integration:\n1. Pre-built Nodes:\n○ n8n provides a collection of built-in nodes for popular services like Google\nSheets, Slack, and Trello.\n○ These nodes simplify the process of connecting and interacting with external\napplications.\n2. HTTP Request Node:\n○ For services without dedicated nodes, ","the HTTP Request node allows you to\ninteract with any API by configuring HTTP methods, headers, and payloads.\n3. Custom Nodes:\n○ Develop custom nodes to cater to specific integration requirements not covered\nby existing nodes.\n○ These can be published as community nodes (and a great place to check out\nhow to do them or if they’ve already been created!)\nAuthentication and Credentials:\n\n● OAuth2: Used by services like Google and Facebook for secure authorization.\n● API Keys: Simple tokens provided by services to authenticate requests.\n● Basic Authentication: Uses a username and password combination for access.\nResources:\n● Understanding APIs in n8n: Watch the Video on YouTube\n● n8n Blog: Definitive Guide to API Integration for Engineers\nOffers an in-depth look at API integration concepts and practices.\n● n8n Documentation: Integrations\nProvides comprehensive guides on integrating various services with n8n.\n● n8n Community Forum: Automate Screenshots, PDFs, and More: Integrating n8n\nwith ","Self-Hosted Browserless & Playwright\nDiscusses advanced integration scenarios and their implementations.\nModule 2: Quick Recap\n● You now understand nodes in n8n: What they are, their types (Trigger Nodes and\nRegular Nodes), and their role as the building blocks of workflows. You’ve learned how\nnodes connect to define the sequence and flow of data.\n● You’ve explored core nodes: The Set Node for defining and manipulating data, the\nFunction Node for running custom JavaScript, the HTTP Request Node for interacting\nwith APIs, and the Merge Node for combining data from multiple sources.\n● You’ve learned how to use expressions: Dynamically access and manipulate data\nusing expressions like \n{{$json[\"field\"]}} \n(current node data) and\n{{$node[\"PreviousNode\"].json[\"field\"]}} \n(data from previous nodes).\n● You’ve mastered data transformations: Leveraging the Set Node for simple\nmodifications and the Function Node for advanced operations like date formatting, array\nfiltering, and calculations usin","g JavaScript.\n● You now understand variables and notation in n8n: Using global variables (\n$json\n,\n$node\n, \n$workflow\n) and applying dot notation or square bracket notation to access and\nmanipulate nested JSON data.\n● You’ve learned how to integrate third-party services: Using pre-built nodes for\npopular applications, the HTTP Request Node for API interactions, and different\nauthentication methods (OAuth2, API Keys, and Basic Auth) to ensure secure\nconnections.\n\nModule 3: Building and Managing Workflows\nLesson 3.1: Designing Effective Workflows\nUnderstanding Workflow Design\nEffective workflow design is crucial for automating processes seamlessly.

This\nguide provides strategies to help you understand and implement effective debugging and\nerror-handling techniques.\n1. Understanding Errors in n8n\nErrors in n8n can arise from various sources, including misconfigured nodes, incorrect data\ninputs, or external service failures. Recognizing the types and origins of errors is the first step\ntoward effective debugging.\n2. Utilizing Execution Data\nn8n maintains detailed execution data for each workflow run, encompassing node data,\nparameters, variables, execution context, and binary data references. This information is\ninvaluable for debugging and"," monitoring your workflows. You can configure how much\nexecution data n8n stores in the database through environment variables or workflow settings.\nn8n Docs\n3. Accessing the Executions Log\nThe Executions Log records details of each workflow run, including successes and failures. To\naccess it:\n\n● Click on the \"Executions\" option in the left-side panel of the n8n editor.\n● Review the list to find executions marked as \"Error.\"\n● Select an execution to view detailed information about the error, including the node\nwhere it occurred and the error message.\nThis log helps pinpoint the exact location and nature of issues, facilitating targeted\ntroubleshooting.\n4. Implementing Error Workflows with the Error Trigger Node\nn8n offers an \"Error Trigger\" node that activates a separate workflow whenever an error occurs\nin your main workflow. This feature is useful for automating error notifications and handling.\nSetting Up an Error Workflow:\n● Create a new workflow dedicated to error handling.\n● Add ","the \"Error Trigger\" node as the starting point.\n● Configure subsequent nodes to define actions upon errors, such as sending an email or\na Slack message with error details.\n● In your main workflow, navigate to \"Workflow Settings\" and assign the newly created\nerror workflow as the designated error handler.\nThis setup ensures that any errors in your main workflow automatically trigger the error\nworkflow, providing immediate notifications and facilitating prompt resolution.\nn8n Docs\n5. Handling Errors Within the Workflow\nn8n allows you to manage errors directly within a workflow using the \"Continue On Fail\" option.\nThis setting enables a node to continue executing even if it encounters an error, allowing the\nworkflow to proceed with alternative actions.\nUsing \"Continue On Fail\":\n● Click on the node you want to configure.\n● In the node's settings, enable the \"Continue On Fail\" option.\n● Optionally, handle the error output by connecting the node's error output to subsequent\nnodes designed to"," manage errors.\nThis approach allows for more resilient workflows that can handle errors gracefully without\nabrupt termination.\nn8n Docs\n6. Utilizing the Debug Helper Node\n\nThe Debug Helper node assists in inspecting and understanding the data passing through your\nworkflow, making it easier to identify issues.\nUsing the Debug Helper Node:\n● Insert the Debug Helper node at various points in your workflow where you want to\ninspect data.\n● Execute the workflow in manual mode to observe the data output at each stage.\n● Analyze the data to ensure it matches your expectations and identify any discrepancies.\nThis practice allows you to monitor the data flow within your workflow, making it easier to spot\nand correct errors.\n7. Best Practices for Debugging and Error Handling\n● Modular Workflow Design:\n○ Break down complex workflows into smaller, manageable modules.\n○ Test each module independently to ensure functionality before integrating them\ninto a larger workflow.\n● Comprehensive Testing:\n○"," Test workflows with various data inputs to cover different scenarios and edge\ncases.\n○ Regular testing helps identify potential issues before they affect production.\n● Implementing Error Branches:\n○ Configure nodes to handle errors gracefully by setting up error branches.\n○ This approach allows the workflow to continue executing alternative actions when\nan error occurs, rather than terminating abruptly.\n● Regular Monitoring and Maintenance:\n○ Regularly review the Executions log to monitor workflow performance and identify\nrecurring issues.\n○ Update and maintain workflows to adapt to changes in external services or data\nstructures.\nBy following these practices, you can enhance the reliability and efficiency of your n8n\nworkflows, ensuring they perform as intended even when unexpected issues arise.\n8.

A well-constructed prompt enables the AI to understand the task better, leading to\nmore accurate and relevant responses. While effective prompting is powerful, it should be\ncombined wit","h other strategies for critical use cases, as large language models (LLMs) can\nstruggle with tasks requiring precision, such as accurate word counts or exact numerical\noutputs.\n\nKey Elements of a Good Prompt\n1. Clarity\nBe explicit about what you want the AI to do.\n● Example: Instead of \"Summarize this,\" use \"Summarize the following article in 3 bullet\npoints.\"\n2. Context\nProvide enough background information or context for the AI to understand the scope.\n● Example: \"You are a customer support agent. Respond to this query professionally.\"\n3. Constraints\nSpecify any rules or limitations for the output.\n● Example: \"Write a response in less than 100 words.\"\n4. Examples (Multi-shot Prompting)\nUse one or more examples (shots) to guide the AI on the desired format, tone, or structure.\nRelevant examples significantly improve task success.\n● Zero-shot prompting: No example provided. Example: \"Translate this sentence into\nFrench.\"\n● One-shot prompting: A single example. Example: \"Translate the s","entence below into\nFrench. Example: 'Hello' -> 'Bonjour.'\"\n● Few-shot prompting: Multiple examples to guide the AI.\n○ Example:\n\"Translate these sentences into French:\n1. 'Hello' -> 'Bonjour'\n2. 'How are you?' -> 'Comment ça va?'\nNow translate: 'Good morning.'\"\nPrompting Strategies\n1. Task Specification\nDirectly state the goal of the task.\n\n● Example: \"Translate the following text into Spanish.\"\n2. Iterative Refinement\nRefine your prompt based on the AI’s output to get closer to your desired response.\n● Example: After receiving a vague summary, adjust the prompt to: \"Summarize this text\nwith a focus on the key findings.\"\n3. Role Assignment\nAssign a specific role to the AI for contextual responses.\n● Example: \"You are a legal advisor. Draft a brief based on this contract clause.\"\n4. Temperature Control\nAdjust the creativity level of the AI for different outputs using parameters like temperature or\ntop-p in tools like GPT-based models.\n● Example:\n○ Lower temperature (e.g., 0.2) for precis","e answers: \"Provide a factual summary of\nthis data.\"\n○ Higher temperature (e.g., 0.8) for creative outputs: \"Write a fictional story about a\nrobot in the future.\"\nHealth Warning: Combining Prompting with Other Strategies\nWhile prompting can significantly enhance the performance of AI models, LLMs may struggle\nwith tasks requiring exact accuracy, such as counting or strict adherence to constraints like word\nlimits. For such use cases, consider combining prompting with validation strategies,\npost-processing, or external checks to ensure the desired output quality.\nTools for Testing Prompts\n1. OpenAI Playground:\n○ Experiment with different prompts and parameters to optimize outputs.\n○ Visit Playground\n2.

Each node represents a\nspecific task or action, such as retrieving data from an API, processing information, or sending\nan email. By connecting nodes, you define the sequence and logic of your automated\nprocesses.\nTypes of Nodes:\n1. Trigger Nodes:\n○ Initiate workflows based on specific events or schedules. A trigger node is\nidentified by an orange lightning bolt.\n○ Examples:\n■ Webhook Trigger: Starts a workflow when a specific URL is called.\n■ Execute Workflow Trigger: Starts a workflow when another workflow\ncalls it.\n■ Gmail Trigger: Starts a workflow when an email is received."}},{"json":{"chunks":"\n2. Regular Nodes:\n○ Perform actions like data retrieval, transformation, and delivery.\n○ Examples:\n■ HTTP Request Node: Makes HTTP requests to external APIs.\n■ Filter Node: Filters data on a defined condition.\n■ Merge Node: Appends or combines two datasets\n\nNode Structure\nEach node comprises:\n● Parameters: Settings that define the node's behavior (e.g., API endpoints,\nauthentication details).\n● Input/Output Data: Data received from preceding nodes and passed to subsequent\nnodes.\n● Credentials (Not Always): Authentication information for accessing external services\nsecurely.\nConnecting Nodes:\nNodes are linked to establish the flow of data and the sequence of operations. The output of\none node becomes the input for the next, creating a cohesive workflow.\nResources:\n● Connecting Google Credentials in 5 Minutes: Watch the Video on YouTube\n● Lead Nurturing Automated Workflow: Watch the Video on YouTube\n● AI Inbox Manager: Watch the Video on YouTube\n● n8n Documentation: Nodes\nProvides detai"}},{"json":{"chunks":"led information on the various nodes available in n8n and their\nfunctionalities.\n● n8n Community Forum: Code Node for Beginners\nOffers insights and examples on using the Code node effectively.

This lesson focuses on manipulating data to ensure compatibility and streamline\nautomation workflows. You'll explore tools like the Set Node, expressions, and the Function\nNode for handling both simple and complex data transformations. Additionally, you'll learn about\nvariables and the notation used in n8n for accessing and manipulating data.\n1. Understanding Data Structures in n8n\nJSON Format in n8n\nIn n8n, nodes output a payload of data represented as a JSON array of objects. Each top-level\nobject in the payload is considered an Item of data in n8n. By default, every node in n8n\nperforms its configured action on each incoming item routed into its input.\nUnderstanding the structure of JSON is crucial for efficiently manipulating and extracting data in\nworkflows. Here are the key JSON components:\n● Key-Value Pairs: \n{ \"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30 }\n● Arrays: \n[ \"ite"}},{"json":{"chunks":"m1\", \"item2\", \"item3\" ]\n● Nested Objects: \n{ \"customer\": { \"name\": \"John\", \"email\":\n\"john@example.com\" } }\nNavigating Nested Data\nTo work with nested data, you can access fields using dot notation or square bracket\nnotation, and you can reference previous node data in two ways:\n● Relative Referencing: Use \n$json \nto access the immediately previous node’s data.\n○ Example: \n{{$json[\"customer\"][\"name\"]}} \naccesses the \n\"name\" \nfield\ninside \n\"customer\" \nfrom the current node's data.\n● Absolute Referencing: Use \n$node[\"NodeName\"].json \nto access data from a\nspecific previous node.\n\n○ Example: \n{{$node[\"Webhook\"].json[\"data\"][\"order\"][\"id\"]}}\nretrieves the \n\"id\" \nfield from the \n\"order\" \nobject output by the Webhook node.\nThis distinction between relative and absolute referencing ensures flexibility when working with\ndata from multiple nodes, enabling efficient data manipulation and workflow construction.\nResources:\n● Understanding the data structure | n8n Docs\n● Quick Primer on data structu"}},{"json":{"chunks":"res in n8n\n2. Using the Set Node\nThe Edit Fields (Set) Node allows you to define and modify data fields within a workflow.\n● Static Data:\nAdd predefined static values to a workflow. Example:\n○ Adding a constant like \n\"company\": \"N8N Inc.\" \nfor use in later nodes.\n● Dynamic Data:\nMap and transform incoming data to new fields. Example:\n○ Input: \n{\"orderId\": \"12345\"}\n○ Output with Set Node: \n{\"Order_ID\": \"12345\"}\nSteps to Use the Edit Fields (Set) Node:\n1. Add the Edit Fields (Set) Node to your workflow.\n2. Define fields under \"Values\" → \"Add Field.\"\n3. Use expressions like \n{{$json[\"fieldName\"]}} \nto map dynamic data.\nResources:\n● Transform data in Google Sheets | n8n workflow template\n● n8n Nodemation basic - transforming json (3/3) (Tutorial)\n3. Expressions in n8n\nUsing Expressions in n8n\n\nExpressions in n8n allow you to dynamically access, transform, and use data from nodes. They\nfunction much like a mail merge, where placeholders are replaced with actual values from your\nworkflow.\nKe"}},{"json":{"chunks":"y Expressions\n1. Accessing Data\n● Current Node Data: Use {{$json[\"field\"]}} to access data from the current node.\nExample: \n{{$json[\"firstName\"]}} \nretrieves the value of the \n\"firstName\" \nfield\nfrom the current node's data.\n● Previous Node Data: Use {{$node[\"NodeName\"].json[\"field\"]}} to retrieve data from a\nspecific previous node.\nExample: {{$node[\"Webhook\"].json[\"order\"][\"id\"]}} retrieves the \"id\" field from the \"order\"\nobject output by the Webhook node.\n2. Combining Fields\n● You can combine fields and text to create dynamic outputs:\n○ Example: \nHello {{ $json[\"firstName\"] }}\n○ Output: \nHello John.\n3. Alternative Syntax\nWhile {{\"Hello \" + $json[\"firstName\"]}} is also valid, the simpler syntax {{\n$json[\"firstName\"] }} \nis often preferred in low-code environments for readability and\nease of use.\nWhy This Matters\nThinking of expressions as a \"mail merge\" can help you grasp their flexibility in customizing\noutputs, making them intuitive for both technical and non-technical users.\nPracti"}},{"json":{"chunks":"cal Use:\n● Combine dynamic text fields for an email subject line:\n○ \n{{$json[\"firstName\"] + \" placed order #\" +\n$json[\"orderId\"]}}\nResources:\n● n8n Tutorials - YouTube\n\n4. Advanced Data Manipulations with the Function Node\nThe Code Node in n8n lets you use custom JavaScript for complex data transformations. It\nprovides flexibility for advanced use cases, as long as the output is a valid n8n item format: an\narray of objects (or an empty array).\nExamples\nDate Conversion\nConvert a timestamp into a readable format:\nreturn [{ date: new Date($json[\"timestamp\"]).toLocaleString() }];\nArray Filtering\nExtract specific items from an array:\nreturn $json[\"items\"].filter(item => item.price > 50);\nPerform Calculations\nCalculate a total amount:\nreturn [{ totalPrice: $json[\"quantity\"] * $json[\"unitPrice\"] }];\nSteps to Use the Code Node\n1. Add the Code Node to your workflow.\n2. Write your JavaScript code in the \"Code\" section.\n3. Use \nreturn \nto output transformed data in the required format: an array o"}},{"json":{"chunks":"f objects or an\nempty array.\nKey Note\nAlways ensure the output adheres to n8n’s expected format. For example:\nValid Output:\nreturn [{ key1: \"value1\", key2: \"value2\" }];\nEmpty Output:\nreturn [];\nBy adhering to this format, your workflows will run smoothly and handle data correctly.\nResources:\n● Process data using code | n8n Docs\n\n● Code Node for Beginners - Tips & Tricks\n5. Variables in n8n and Understanding the Notation\nIn n8n, variables are essential for accessing and manipulating data within workflows.\nUnderstanding how to utilize these variables and the appropriate notation is crucial for effective\nworkflow development.\nTypes of Variables:\n1. Helper Variables:\n○ \n$json\n: Represents the data of the current node. It's commonly used to access\nthe input data within the node where the expression is written.\ni. Resource: n8n Documentation\n○ \n$node\n: Allows access to the output data of other nodes in the workflow. This is\nparticularly useful when you need to reference data from previous no"}},{"json":{"chunks":"des.\n○ \n$workflow\n: Provides information about the current workflow, such as its name\nand ID. This can be helpful for logging or conditional operations based on\nworkflow metadata.\ni. Resource: n8n Documentation\n○ \n$env\n: Enables access to environment variables set in your n8n instance. This is\nuseful for managing configuration values that may vary between different\nenvironments (e.g., development, staging, production).\ni. Resource: n8n Community\nNotation for Accessing Data:\nDot Notation:\nUsed to access object properties directly when the property names are simple (i.e., they don't\ncontain spaces, special characters, or start with a number).\n{{$json.customer.name}}\n● In this example, \ncustomer \nis an object within the current node's JSON data, and \nname\nis a property of that object.\nSquare Bracket Notation:\nNecessary when property names include spaces, special characters, or are dynamic (e.g.,\nstored in another variable).\n{{$json[\"customer name\"]}}\n\n● This approach ensures that property"}},{"json":{"chunks":" names with spaces or special characters are\ncorrectly interpreted.\nAccessing Data from Other Nodes:\nTo reference data from a different node within your workflow, use the \n$node \nvariable combined\nwith the appropriate notation:\n{{$node[\"PreviousNodeName\"].json[\"fieldName\"]}}\nReplace \n\"PreviousNodeName\" \nwith the exact name of the node you're referencing and\n\"fieldName\" \nwith the specific field you wish to access.\nPractical Example:\nSuppose you have a node named \"Webhook\" that receives the following JSON payload:\n{\n\"order\": {\n\"id\": \"12345\",\n\"customer\": {\n\"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n\"email\": \"jane.doe@example.com\"\n},\n\"items\": [\n{\n\"product\": \"Laptop\",\n\"quantity\": 1,\n\"price\": 1200\n}\n]\n}\n}\nTo extract the customer's email from this payload in a subsequent node, you would use:\n{{$node[\"Webhook\"].json[\"order\"][\"customer\"][\"email\"]}}\n\nThis expression drills down through the nested JSON structure to retrieve the desired value.\nBest Practices:\n● Consistent Naming: Use consistent and descriptive names for"}},{"json":{"chunks":" your nodes and data\nfields to make expressions more readable and maintainable.\n● Error Handling: Be cautious of null or undefined values when accessing nested\nproperties. Consider using optional chaining (e.g., \n{{$json?.customer?.name}}\n) to\nprevent errors if a property doesn't exist.\n● Testing Expressions: Utilize n8n's expression editor to test and validate your\nexpressions, ensuring they return the expected results before implementing them in your\nworkflow.\nLesson 2.4: Integrating Third-Party Services\nConnecting to External Applications:\nn8n enables seamless integration with various third-party services, allowing for automated data\nexchange and process management across platforms.\nMethods of Integration:\n1.

While effective prompting is powerful, it should be\ncombined wit"}},{"json":{"chunks":"h other strategies for critical use cases, as large language models (LLMs) can\nstruggle with tasks requiring precision, such as accurate word counts or exact numerical\noutputs.\n\nKey Elements of a Good Prompt\n1. Clarity\nBe explicit about what you want the AI to do.\n● Example: Instead of \"Summarize this,\" use \"Summarize the following article in 3 bullet\npoints.\"\n2. Context\nProvide enough background information or context for the AI to understand the scope.\n● Example: \"You are a customer support agent. Respond to this query professionally.\"\n3. Constraints\nSpecify any rules or limitations for the output.\n● Example: \"Write a response in less than 100 words.\"\n4. Examples (Multi-shot Prompting)\nUse one or more examples (shots) to guide the AI on the desired format, tone, or structure.\nRelevant examples significantly improve task success.\n● Zero-shot prompting: No example provided. Example: \"Translate this sentence into\nFrench.\"\n● One-shot prompting: A single example. Example: \"Translate the s"}},{"json":{"chunks":"entence below into\nFrench. Example: 'Hello' -> 'Bonjour.'\"\n● Few-shot prompting: Multiple examples to guide the AI.\n○ Example:\n\"Translate these sentences into French:\n1. 'Hello' -> 'Bonjour'\n2. 'How are you?' -> 'Comment ça va?'\nNow translate: 'Good morning.'\"\nPrompting Strategies\n1. Task Specification\nDirectly state the goal of the task.\n\n● Example: \"Translate the following text into Spanish.\"\n2. Iterative Refinement\nRefine your prompt based on the AI’s output to get closer to your desired response.\n● Example: After receiving a vague summary, adjust the prompt to: \"Summarize this text\nwith a focus on the key findings.\"\n3. Role Assignment\nAssign a specific role to the AI for contextual responses.\n● Example: \"You are a legal advisor. Draft a brief based on this contract clause.\"\n4. Temperature Control\nAdjust the creativity level of the AI for different outputs using parameters like temperature or\ntop-p in tools like GPT-based models.\n● Example:\n○ Lower temperature (e.g., 0.2) for precis"}},{"json":{"chunks":"e answers: \"Provide a factual summary of\nthis data.\"\n○ Higher temperature (e.g., 0.8) for creative outputs: \"Write a fictional story about a\nrobot in the future.\"\nHealth Warning: Combining Prompting with Other Strategies\nWhile prompting can significantly enhance the performance of AI models, LLMs may struggle\nwith tasks requiring exact accuracy, such as counting or strict adherence to constraints like word\nlimits. For such use cases, consider combining prompting with validation strategies,\npost-processing, or external checks to ensure the desired output quality.\nTools for Testing Prompts\n1.
